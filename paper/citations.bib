The following is Anoop's paper on pose estimation in videos using HoG features
and a simple graphical model.

  author={Cherian, Arun and Mairal, Julien and Alahari, Karteek and Schmid, Cordelia},
  booktitle={CVPR},
  year={2014}
}

The following papers are on deep learning for pose detection in single frames.
Both were recommended by Anoop (2015-07-24).

The next few papers are all related to clothing parsing, and each use Yang and
Ramanan's pose estimator in some way

      Lu, Hanqing and Yan, Shuicheng},
  booktitle={{CVPR}},
  year={2012}

The next paper is about comparing action recognition with pose estimation to
action recognition with lower-level features. It has a stupid title, but the
answer is "yes, it does".
@inproceedings{yao2011does,
  title={Does Human Action Recognition Benefit from Pose Estimation?},
  author={Yao, Angela and Gall, Juergen and Fanelli, Gabriele and Van Gool, Luc J},
  booktitle={BMVC},

This next paper is about using pose estimation to recognise inanimate objects
which people interact with (e.g. chairs, carpets, computer desks, etc.)
@incollection{delaitre2012scene,
  title={Scene semantics from long-term observation of people},
  author={Delaitre, Vincent and Fouhey, David F and Laptev, Ivan and Sivic, Josef and Gupta, Abhinav and Efros, Alexei A},

Here's AlexNet!

Distance transforms for graphical models

Following seems to be the original PSM article. Good god, their energy function
is trivial; they seem to be assigning infinite energy to configurations in which
*any* part lies outside a part-specific box defined by them, and zero energy to
configurations in which no part is in that position! Nevertheless, they deserve
kudos for being so far ahead of their time in their use of "springs" to describe
ideal configurations.

Another pictorial structures paper. I could replace the "Distance Transforms of
Sampled Functions" paper with this one, but I prefer the DToSF paper since it's
more concise.
@article{felzenszwalb2005pictorial,
  title={Pictorial structures for object recognition},

Here are some NN pose estimation papers

This one compares the use of a variety of "motion features", including optical
flow, at the input layer of a DCNN
@incollection{jain2014modeep,
  title={{MoDeep}: A deep learning framework using motion features for human pose estimation},
  author={Jain, Arjun and Tompson, Jonathan and LeCun, Yann and Bregler, Christoph},
  booktitle={ACCV},
  year={2014}
}

Probably the first application of CNNs to pose estimation. Uses direct
coordinate regression with refinement CNNs. Good results relative to what came
before, poor results relative to what came after.
@inproceedings{toshev2014deeppose,
  title={{DeepPose}: Human pose estimation via deep neural networks},
  author={Toshev, Alexander and Szegedy, Christian},
  booktitle={CVPR},
  year={2014}
}

Uses heatmaps rather than coordinate regression, which they criticise on the
basis that coordinate mappings are highly nonlinear and get confused by pooling
(which throws away spatial information)
@article{jain2013learning,
  title={Learning human pose estimation features with convolutional networks},
  author={Jain, Arjun and Tompson, Jonathan and Andriluka, Mykhaylo and Taylor, Graham W and Bregler, Christoph},
  journal={arXiv:1312.7302},
  year={2013}

Kind-of meh paper from Zisserman group. Looks like an attempt to just get
*some* results (any results!) and publish them. The flowing convnets paper
builds on the ideas in this one and is, in my opinion, more interesting.
@incollection{pfister2015deep,
  title={Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Efficient Pose Estimation in Gesture Videos},

Miscellaneous pose estimation papers

Chain-structured CRFs on the left and right side of the body, with a "mode"
setting for each side corresponding to some quality like gender, height, whether
sitting or standing, arms folded, arms raised, etc. The left and right mode
nodes are connected. Anoop's paper explained this as "...a strategy where the
model is represented as a convex combination of tree-structured graphs linked
with dual variables, and solve it with a dual decomposition algorithm."
@inproceedings{sapp2013modec,
  title={{MODEC}: Multimodal decomposable models for human pose estimation},
  author={Sapp, Brian and Taskar, Ben},
  booktitle={CVPR},

Using random forest-based regressors, conditioned on a "global variable" (like
the one used in MODEC) which is known at evaluation time.

This paper tries to track faces by detecting a face in an initial frame and then
tracking it through subsequent frames by detecting pupils using a near IR camera
with IR light and applying a Kalman filter (or similar) for smoothing

Another detect-in-each-frame-then-track paper. This one uses a HMM applied to
detected pose bounding boxes for the tracking part.

temporal links.
