# Miscellaneous Cherian, Mairal, Alahari & Schmid code

This directory contains some code from Cherian et al. ("Mixing Body-Part
Sequences for Human Pose Estimation", CVPR '14) which I've found helpful. I
adapted a lot of this for a research course in 2015, so I don't know how much of
this code is actually original.
